node per station
edge per route

when dijkstras is run, edge has equal weighting regardless of which route is taken. this causes a lot of changing within the same line.
there are no weighted edges. cannot add these dynamically when running dijkstras (same route then lower weight) as the previous node
would be the same for both, the weight is equal and the route chosen will be random.


example:

canada water -> surrey quays -> queens road peckham. one train is required
stratford -> queens road peckham. change at surrey quays.

changing at surrey quays (overground route A) is the same weight as surrey quays (overground route B) when changing from canada water jubilee.
because both edges (routes A and B) lead to the same node, it doesn't matter which one it takes. The next step is from surrey quays -> queens road peckham which is NOT available
on route A but is available on route B. Therefore a change is done to route B.

To fix:
create nodes for each station + line e.g. stratford - dlr, stratford - central, stratford - overground. Link them with edge (line: 'change line'). Weights won't be needed as changing line within the same station
is an extra edge so should be more expensive by default. penalising changing lines: could add higher weighting on same station edges.
